         <p>
            So as you can see formt he title and header above, my name is Mohammed Alam, and I am a student
            in the Computing Exploration Major here at RIT. I was unsure about what I wanted to major in, but 
            I knew it had to be about computers.
         </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Name: Mohammed Alam</li>
              <li>Age: 18 as of 8/27/2020</li>
              <li>Major: Computing Exploration Student in RIT</li>
              <li>Origin: I'm form New York City, where I currently still am</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="info">Basic programming information</h2>
         
            <p>
                My programming experience is a bit sporadic, and I don't know where it goes most of the time
                I have 3 years of learning experience for programming languages in highschool as follows
            </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Sophomore Year of H.S.</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>I tried my first ever programming class here, AP computer science principles
                and I didn't like the class, but I thought it was because I had a disinterest
                in programming, but it was truly because I really didn't care for the class, and I 
                would have friends that do everything for me, so I thought of it as pretty hard
                and never gave effort because I didn't have to. I was supposed to learn the languages 
                of SNAP/SCRATCH, and Processing. I did a meh final year project and did meh on the AP 
                exam with a score of 3, barely enough to get by without programming. </p>
            </dd>

            <dt>Junior Year of H.S.</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Well I thought software wasn't for me, and I loved building computers so I thought
                the mechanical engineering process was the way for me to go, so I chose a high school
                major called mechatronics & robotics because I thought it was fascinating, it pretty 
                much was, I would learn a language called Arduino- which is a circuitry learning company
                with different types of circuity pieces and circuits, we could code and tinker with. I would
                make things such as calculators with the in the computer screen and use the digital push buttons 
                as keys, and other things such as a button pressed sound and light shows displaying different 
                light brightnesses and sound values. It was hard but pretty fun. </p>

                <p>I had to perform with another programming language called Robot-C, a version of C that 
                is used by robots made by VEX, and we can programm them and map them to specific buttons, 
                keys and controllers to do things like, display and LED, move this way, turn this way, and etc.
                I was getting more accusotmed to it but the year ended so meh. </p>

                <p>Over the Summer I had a job and really didn't do much programming so I forgot a good deal 
                about these languages, which I somewhat regretted. </p>
            </dd>

            <dt>Senior Year of H.S.</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>I've had a mroe defined level of programming knowledge this year. TO keep it short I learned
                this thing called labview which was sort of a drag and drop program but the National Instruments
                LABview circuitry, which was a pain, but still pretty cool. I learned various mechancial languages 
                such as robocell which allowed me to control a robot's arm by programming the joints, to do 
                things such as draw and write. I learned how to carve designs into resign and wooden blocks with 
                CNC machining languages, I learned to also use Autodesk inventor, not a prgramming language, but 
                a professional designing tool which I was supposed ot get my PLTW certification for, along with 
                the other languages. It was fun and I honed my level of Robot-C to an intermediate-advanced degree. </p>
                
                <p>I regretted not taking APCSA, or Java, which a lot of my firends took, and wouldn've helped me, 
                because I learned I actually loved programming and just wasn't exposed to a great initial enviornment
                so it was a decision I regreted. </p>

                <p>I was supposed to use all these to display some final projects using industrial level 
                machinery to make projects and robots. Like this one metal rocket piece I made with a plasma cutter,
                and a huge robot that was supposed to play ping pong, albeit very slowly. We had to stop becuase of 
                the pandemic, so at home I was taught Python and I did some rudimentary HTML and CSS by myself, that 
                might get me by for a week or two. </p>

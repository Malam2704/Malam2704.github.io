        <p>Well when you think of New York City skyscrapers, none of these buildings come up, atleast the noticeable ones don't.
            You see, the tallest ones in the image, One VanderBilt, Central Park Tower, and the Steinway Tower are all buildings completed or will be completed in 2021.
            You don't see the Empire State, Metlife, World Trade Center, Chrysler building or anything Iconic, because these are new luxury residential developments being made
            with some penthouses goign up for $100 million. One notable cluster is the Hudson Yards Project, known as the Largest Private development in American History costing $24 billion.
        </p>
        <p>There are more skyscrapers in this city than the next 9 cities combined in the entire nation. And we're not stopping. We've yet to build new projects, such as the Spiral, a skyscraper
            surrounded by trees, and another building called the Jenga tower, and like it's namesake, looks like a Jenga Game.

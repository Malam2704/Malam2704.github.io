        <p>Well New York city is a hub of Immigration, rated an A++ city in the world, and it didn't just get that name without reason.
            We have various neighborhoods thriving with diversity, 800 languages here with one person from each country in the world. We have the most diverse county in America, Queens county, nearly 1/4th, Hispanic, Asian, Black, & White each.
        </p>
        <p>
            In New York city, there are record number of Immigrants from all over the world, which makes our food even better. We have the most unique Ethnicities in America, and
            are a hub for the highest population of many of these groups such as Russian, Ukranian, Italian, Polish, Ecuadorian, Greek, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Irish, Bengali, Chinese,
            Indonesian, Pakistani, Indian, and way too many more I don't have enough time to name.
        </p>
        <p>Remember, there's a reason we have the UN building, a literal skyscraper with a piece of the world.</p>

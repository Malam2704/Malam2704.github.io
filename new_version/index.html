            <p class="p1">
                Well, my name is Mohammed Alam, and I'm from New York City.
                I am currently a Computing Exploration Major at RIT, looking at either Software
                Engineering, Computer Science, or Web & Mobile Computing.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                My hobbies include playing video games, trading in the stock market, and 
                doign some general research about a few topics I deem interesting, such as
                the elections, infastructure development, and any data that pertains to maps.
                I have thousands of hours of history on these maps alone. 
            </p>
            <p class="p3">For Programming, I have been doing so since my Sophmore Year fo Highschool
               Transitioning through the drag and drgo based programs in Scratch, in AP CS to
               Java in my Software Development Class. I've dabbled in Python the most, and I would
               say I'm the most confident using Python's Object Oriented framework. 
            </p>
            <p class="p4">My email is ma3655@rit.edu / ma3655@g.rit.edu , so if you have any questions ask away.</p>
